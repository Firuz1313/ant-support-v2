Openbox Gold TV & Remote Control Page — Full Design Description
===============================================================

1. GENERAL OVERVIEW
-------------------
- The page simulates a real TV interface and remote control for the Openbox Gold set-top box.
- The design is modern, visually rich, and highly interactive, optimized for both desktop and mobile.
- All interactions are performed via a virtual remote control, mimicking the real Openbox Gold remote.

2. LAYOUT STRUCTURE
-------------------
- The main content is centered on the page, with a virtual TV screen on the left (or top on mobile) and a realistic remote control on the right (or bottom on mobile).
- The layout uses a responsive grid/flexbox system to adapt to different screen sizes.
- The background is a dark, gradient-rich color, giving a cinematic and immersive feel.

3. TV SCREEN COMPONENT
----------------------
- The TV screen is a large, rounded rectangle with a thick border and shadow, simulating a real TV frame.
- The screen displays:
  - The main menu with app icons (e.g., Channel Editor, Settings, YouTube, IPTV, etc.), each with a unique icon and color.
  - A channel list modal with a left panel (panel 1-5: Del, Move, Skip, Lock, Fav) and a scrollable list of channels.
  - Channel info and a mini-preview area.
  - A modal confirmation window for deleting channels, centered on the TV, with "Cancel" and "Delete" buttons.
- Visual feedback (highlight, border, glow) is used to indicate selection and focus.
- When in delete mode, selected channels show a bold red cross icon.
- All overlays and modals use soft drop-shadows, rounded corners, and semi-transparent backgrounds.

4. REMOTE CONTROL COMPONENT
---------------------------
- The remote is a vertical, pill-shaped block with a realistic look: gradients, shadows, and glossy highlights.
- Buttons are grouped and styled to match the real Openbox Gold remote:
  - Power, navigation (up/down/left/right/ok), numbers, function keys, colored buttons, etc.
  - Each button has a unique color, shape, and icon/label.
  - Pressed state is shown with a shadow and slight movement.
- All user actions (navigation, selection, exit, etc.) are performed by clicking/tapping the virtual remote buttons.
- No keyboard or mouse navigation is used for TV control.

5. INTERACTIONS & LOGIC
-----------------------
- All navigation and actions are handled via the remote; the TV screen responds visually to remote events.
- Panel 1-5 (Del, Move, Skip, Lock, Fav) can be activated by clicking the corresponding remote button or the on-screen panel.
- In delete mode, channels can be selected for deletion; confirmation is required via a modal.
- Exiting from modals or modes is always done via the Exit button on the remote.
- All state and logic are managed via React Context API.

6. VISUAL STYLE
---------------
- Color palette: deep blues, purples, blacks, with accent colors for buttons and highlights (yellow, red, green, etc.).
- Typography: modern, sans-serif, with clear hierarchy and strong contrast.
- Icons: react-icons library, with custom SVGs for special states (e.g., red cross for delete).
- Animations: smooth transitions for focus, selection, modal appearance, and button presses.
- Shadows and gradients are used extensively for depth and realism.

7. RESPONSIVENESS
-----------------
- The layout adapts for mobile: TV and remote stack vertically, touch targets are enlarged, and spacing is increased.
- All components remain fully functional and visually consistent on any device.

8. TECHNOLOGIES & LIBRARIES
---------------------------
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- CSS-in-JS for dynamic styles
- react-icons for iconography
- Vite for build tooling
- Context API for state management
- No keyboard event handling for TV control (only remote)

9. COMPONENTS & FILE STRUCTURE
------------------------------
- src/components/TVScreen.tsx — TV screen UI and logic
- src/components/RemoteControl.tsx — Virtual remote control
- src/context/TVControlContext.tsx — State and command logic
- src/pages/DeviceRemotePage.tsx — Main page composition
- src/components/ui/ — Reusable UI primitives (modals, buttons, etc.)

10. UX PRINCIPLES
-----------------
- All actions are explicit and visually confirmed.
- Only one main TV+remote block is present on the page.
- All feedback is immediate and visually clear.
- The interface is intuitive for users familiar with real TV remotes.

11. EXTENSIBILITY
-----------------
- The design and logic are modular, allowing for easy addition of new features, apps, or remote layouts.
